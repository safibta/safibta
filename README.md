# Safi Ahmed, Ph.D.

*I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on thermal-fluid CFD simulations. In my Ph.D. I explored the geometrical attributes of cooling channels. Recently I've been interested in solving flow PDEs and topology optimization of fluid flow problems in functional programming paradigm as a next step in my endeavors.*

*I am passionate about using Wolfram Language for scientific programming and have experience applying it across various fields.*

Here are some of my coursework and self-initiated coding projects:

- **[Spherical PCM Temperature](https://github.com/safibta/Spherical-PCM-temperature-profile)** & **[PCM Interface Tracking](https://github.com/safibta/Spherical-PCM-interface)** solve PDE and plot time series solutions for a spherical phase change material sample.
- **[Thruster Control Design](https://github.com/safibta/Underwater-vehicle-thruster-control)** is a script to rectify the slippage issue in an underwater vehicle thruster.
- **[Wastewater FSI Analysis](https://github.com/safibta/Wastewater-screen-FSI)** is an interface for end-user to input wastewater screen configuration and run simulation and visualize the related flow.
- **[Solar AC Capacity Tool](https://github.com/safibta/Solar-efficiency-data)** helps end-user assess solar-powered air conditioners.
- **[Time Integration Scheme Analysis](https://github.com/safibta/Numerical-integration-dispersion-analysis)** & **[Response Curves](https://github.com/safibta/Composite-method-response-curves)** investigate properties of certain time composite numerical schemes.
