# Safi Ahmed Memon, Ph.D.

*I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on thermal-fluid CFD simulations. I am primarily interested in exploring the geometrical attributes of heat sinks. Recently I've been exploring topology optimization as a next step in my endeavors. I am passionate about scientific programming and have done so in several fields. I have also written codes/scripts to assess stability of composite time integration methods.*

Here are the examples of some codes/scripts I have created:

- [Numerical-integration-dispersion-analysis](https://github.com/safibta/Numerical-integration-dispersion-analysis), [Composite-method-response-curves](https://github.com/safibta/Composite-method-response-curves): Analysis of composite time integration schemes and discussing their dispersion properties.
- [Spherical-PCM-temperature-profile](https://github.com/safibta/Spherical-PCM-temperature-profile), [Spherical-PCM-interface](https://github.com/safibta/Spherical-PCM-interface): Spherical Heat Equation Solver for Phase Change Material with Dynamic Visualization.
- [Underwater-vehicle-thruster-control](https://github.com/safibta/Underwater-vehicle-thruster-control): Intelligent Microcontroller Design to Solve Magnetic Bearing Slippage Issue.
- [Wastewater-screen-FSI](https://github.com/safibta/Wastewater-screen-FSI): Software Application for Fluid-Structure Interaction Analysis of Wastewater Screening Mechanism.
- [Solar-efficiency-data](https://github.com/safibta/Solar-efficiency-data): Software Application for Capacity Assessment of Solar-powered Air Conditioner.
